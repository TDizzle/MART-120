Mindset

People with a growth mindset learn from their mistakes and continue to improve small and big things in their lives. My mindset result was 41, which suggests a growth mindset but with some fixed ideas. I don’t think this changed my perspective on mindset, I consider myself a fairly open individual that’s constantly learning, especially being in college.
