Last Lecture
The Last Lecture was a very inspiring presentation. What affected me the most was his positivity. Even though he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and knew he was going to die, he acknowledged that he was in great health, had a loving family, and was excited about living his life.
I really liked his short messages near the end of his presentation, are you Tigger or Eeyore, never lose the childlike wonder, help others, never give up. Randy Pausch is excellent at keeping things funny and lighthearted while hitting home with deep messages that he truly believes in. He wants you to be like Tigger, that is, always look on the bright side.
